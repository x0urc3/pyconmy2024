    "- In general, the HDF5 method significantly outperforms the CSV method on write speed, read speed, and storage size. The best performance in terms of timing occurs for the largest array size of 20,000,000 elements, where the write and read times for HDF5 are only 2.67% and 3.66% of the CSV times, respectively. - most example load from csv - table compare size for csv, numpy and hdf5\n",
    "- motivation time and accuracy not cost - triangle cost, performance and accuracy\n",
    "- focus during acquisition but still applies to other steps - diagram illustrate data flow IE acquisitions, storage, view, preprocess, ml, decision\n",
    "- overhead caused by layered architecture ie barebone, os, container, vm - not applicable since docker/VM can mount volume\n",
